* Play against the computer: In this mode, the computer controls the red team, while the player controls the white team.
## Rules
* Pieces can only move on diagonally unoccupied squares.
* Capture moves are mandatory.
* Multiple captures are allowed.
* The direction of captures can be changed during a sequence.
* Backward captures are allowed.
* A piece reaching the end of the board becomes a king.
* Kings can move any number of squares in any direction.
* Kings can move backward.
* There is a time limit for each move; exceeding it results in a random move.
